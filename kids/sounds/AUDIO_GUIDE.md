# Historical Map Ambient Sound Guide

## Audio Implementation Complete!

The Historical Land of Israel Interactive Map now includes an automatic ambient sound system that plays period-appropriate audio as users explore different historical eras.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Playback**: As users move the timeline slider or navigate between periods, the appropriate ambient sound automatically starts playing
2. **Seamless Looping**: Short audio clips (30-60 seconds) loop continuously for data efficiency
3. **Simple Controls**: Users can toggle sound on/off with a single button - no complex audio controls needed
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: If audio files are missing, the system silently continues without breaking
