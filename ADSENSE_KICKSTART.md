# AdSense Kickstart Guide

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Site Verification & Consent Setup

### Step 1: Verify Site Ownership in AdSense
1. Go to https://adsense.google.com
2. Navigate to **Sites** ‚Üí jerusalemhills.com
3. Select verification method: **AdSense code snippet** (RECOMMENDED)
4. The AdSense script is already in `/js/analytics.js` which loads on all pages ‚úÖ
5. Click "Request Review" to verify ownership

**Status:** AdSense code is deployed on ALL 20+ HTML pages via analytics.js

---

### Step 2: Configure Consent Message (REQUIRED for EU/UK/EEA)

**RECOMMENDED CHOICE:** **3-choice consent message**

In AdSense dashboard under "Privacy & messaging":
- ‚úÖ **Select:** "Use Google's CMP to create a message with 3 choices (Consent, Do not consent, and Manage options)"
- ‚ùå **Avoid:** 2-choice option (less transparent, weaker GDPR compliance)

**Why 3 choices:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit "Do not consent" option (stronger GDPR compliance)
- ‚úÖ More ethical and transparent
- ‚úÖ Future-proof for stricter privacy regulations
- ‚úÖ Reduces legal risk in EU/UK/Switzerland

#### Complete Configuration Settings:

Navigate to **Privacy & messaging** ‚Üí **European regulations** and configure:

**1. Ad Partners:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable:** "Automatically include common ad partners" (200 partners)
- This maximizes ad coverage and revenue

**2. In-Ad Transparency Controls:**
- ‚ùå **Leave unchecked:** "Ask buyers to only show ads with DSA transparency information"
- Warning: Enabling this significantly reduces ad revenue

**3. Check RTB Creatives:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable:** "Check RTB (real-time bidding) partner creatives for ad partner consent"
- Ensures ads comply with user consent choices

**4. Legitimate Interest:**
- ‚ùå **DISABLE:** "Enable by default" (CRITICAL for Limited Ads)
- For cookie-less Limited Ads operation, legitimate interest must be OFF
- If you want personalized ads with consent, enable this

**5. Consent Mode - Advertising:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable:** "Enable consent mode for advertising purposes"
- Allows Google Ads to respect user consent
- Works with your existing AdSense setup

**6. Consent Mode - Analytics:**
- ‚úÖ **Enable:** "Enable consent mode for analytics purposes"
- Your site already uses Google Analytics 4 (G-VE3Z9354M2)
- Analytics will respect user consent choices automatically
- Already configured for privacy-first in `/js/analytics.js`

**7. Special Feature 2:**
- ‚ùå **Leave DISABLED:** Device fingerprinting (not needed for most sites)

#### Quick Settings Checklist:
```
‚úÖ Message Type: 3 choices (Consent, Do not consent, Manage)
‚úÖ Ad Partners: Automatically include (200 partners)
‚úÖ Check RTB Creatives: Enabled
‚ùå In-Ad Transparency: Disabled
‚ùå Legitimate Interest: Disabled (for Limited Ads)
‚úÖ Consent Mode - Advertising: Enabled
‚úÖ Consent Mode - Analytics: Enabled
‚ùå Special Feature 2: Disabled
```

After configuration, click **"Create message"** or **"Save"**.

## üü° What If It's Not Working?

### Issue: AdSense script not loading

**Console shows:** "‚ö†Ô∏è AdSense: Ad cookies detected"

**Solutions:**

5. Some cookies (`_gpi`) may appear for fraud detection only - this is normal

### Issue: No ads showing at all

**Possible Causes:**
1. AdSense account under review (new accounts take 1-3 days)
2. Low traffic (AdSense requires minimum traffic)
3. Content policy violations
4. Ad blocker enabled

**Solutions:**
