## Plan for Building a Live Interactive Backgammon Game Using Static Sites

### **Introduction**
This document details the plan to develop a live, interactive backgammon game that operates entirely on the client-side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will be anonymous, with players identified by auto-generated usernames, and hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages. Peer-to-peer communication will be facilitated using WebRTC or PeerJS to enable real-time interactions.

---

### **Project Goals**
1. **Anonymity**: Players will not need to log in. Random usernames will be generated for each session.
2. **Live Multiplayer**: Players can connect directly for real-time gameplay.
3. **Static Hosting**: The game will be deployed using GitHub Pages, ensuring a simple and free hosting solution.
4. **Backgammon-Specific Logic**: The game will incorporate all standard backgammon rules, including dice rolls, valid moves, and turn-based gameplay.
5. **Responsive Design**: The UI will work seamlessly across devices.

---

### **Technical Stack**
- **HTML/CSS**: For building and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, WebRTC-based communication, and interactivity.
- **PeerJS**: A library to simplify WebRTC communication.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the static files.

---

### **System Architecture**
1. **Game Initialization**:
   - Players visit the site and are assigned a random username.
   - Players share PeerJS IDs with each other to establish a connection.

2. **Game State Management**:
   - A JavaScript object will maintain the current game state, including board positions, dice rolls, and player turns.
   - Game state will be synchronized between peers using WebRTC.

3. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebRTC will handle peer-to-peer communication for sending game moves and syncing states.

4. **UI and Interaction**:
   - A grid-based HTML/CSS layout will represent the backgammon board.
   - Drag-and-drop functionality will enable players to move pieces.
   - Dice rolls and valid moves will be displayed dynamically.

---

### **Implementation Details**

#### **1. Random Username Generation**
Each player will receive a unique username upon visiting the site. A JavaScript function will generate the username:
```javascript
function generateUsername() {
    const adjectives = ["Swift", "Bold", "Lucky", "Clever", "Mighty"];
    const nouns = ["Tiger", "Falcon", "Wolf", "Panther", "Eagle"];
    return adjectives[Math.floor(Math.random() * adjectives.length)] +
           nouns[Math.floor(Math.random() * nouns.length)] +
           Math.floor(1000 + Math.random() * 9000);
}
const username = generateUsername();
console.log("Your username is: " + username);
```

#### **2. Board Layout and Pieces**
The backgammon board will be built using an HTML grid layout styled with CSS. Example code:
```html
<div id="board">
    <!-- Add grid layout for backgammon board here -->
</div>
<style>
#board {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(14, 50px);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(14, 50px);
    width: 700px;
    height: 700px;
    background-color: #f0d9b5;
    border: 2px solid black;
}
.piece {
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-color: #333;
    cursor: grab;
}
</style>
```

#### **3. Real-Time Communication Using PeerJS**
WebRTC will enable peer-to-peer communication, simplified with PeerJS. A sample implementation:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/peerjs@1.4.7/dist/peer.min.js"></script>
<script>
const peer = new Peer();
peer.on("open", (id) => {
    console.log("My peer ID is: " + id);
    alert(`Share this ID with your opponent: ${id}`);
});
peer.on("connection", (conn) => {
    conn.on("data", (data) => {
        console.log("Received move: ", data);
        updateGameState(JSON.parse(data));
    });
});
function connectToPeer(peerId) {
    const conn = peer.connect(peerId);
    conn.on("open", () => {
        conn.send("Hello! Let's play.");
    });
}
</script>
```

#### **4. Game Logic and State Management**
The game state will be represented as an object:
```javascript
let gameState = {
    players: [],
    board: Array(24).fill([]), // Backgammon points
    turn: 0,
};

function updateGameState(move) {
    gameState.board[move.to].push(move.piece);
    gameState.board[move.from].pop();
    gameState.turn = (gameState.turn + 1) % 2;
    broadcastGameState(gameState);
}
function broadcastGameState(state) {
    dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(state));
}
```

#### **5. Local State Persistence**
To allow players to refresh their browser without losing progress, game state will be stored in `localStorage`:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem("gameState", JSON.stringify(gameState));
let savedState = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("gameState"));
if (savedState) {
    gameState = savedState;
}
```

#### **6. Deployment on GitHub Pages**
1. Clone your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Add the game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js`) to the repository root.
3. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add backgammon game"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Pages**.
   - Select `main` branch and save.

---

### **Testing and Debugging**
1. Test the game locally using a local server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
2. Ensure that:
   - The board layout is responsive.
   - Game logic works correctly for various scenarios.
   - Real-time communication is seamless.
3. Debug WebRTC connections using browser developer tools.

---

### **Limitations and Workarounds**
1. **Signaling Server**: Static sites do not support server-side signaling for WebRTC. Use a free or third-party service like PeerJS.
2. **Manual ID Sharing**: Players must manually exchange PeerJS IDs. Future enhancements could include a matchmaking mechanism.
3. **Offline Play**: The game cannot support offline play due to reliance on WebRTC.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Implement matchmaking to connect random players.
2. Add animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.
3. Include advanced backgammon features like doubling cubes.

---

### **Conclusion**
This plan outlines the steps to build and deploy a live, interactive backgammon game entirely on a static site. By leveraging PeerJS for peer-to-peer communication and GitHub Pages for hosting, the project ensures simplicity and accessibility while delivering a fully functional game.
